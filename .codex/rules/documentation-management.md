# Project Documentation Management

### Roadmap & Changelog Maintenance
- **Project Roadmap** (the configured `Docs:` path `development-roadmap.md`): Living document tracking project phases, milestones, and progress
- **Project Changelog** (the configured `Docs:` path `project-changelog.md`): Detailed record of all significant changes, features, and fixes
- **System Architecture** (the configured `Docs:` path `system-architecture.md`): Detailed record of all significant changes, features, and fixes
- **Code Standards** (the configured `Docs:` path `code-standards.md`): Detailed record of all significant changes, features, and fixes

### Automatic Updates Required
- **After Feature Implementation**: Update roadmap progress status and changelog entries
- **After Major Milestones**: Review and adjust roadmap phases, update success metrics
- **After Bug Fixes**: Document fixes in changelog with severity and impact
- **After Security Updates**: Record security improvements and version updates
- **Weekly Reviews**: Update progress percentages and milestone statuses

### Documentation Triggers
The `project_manager` agent MUST update these documents when:
- A development phase status changes (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Complete")
- Major features are implemented or released
- Significant bugs are resolved or security patches applied
- Project timeline or scope adjustments are made
- External dependencies or breaking changes occur

### Update Protocol
1. **Before Updates**: Always read current roadmap and changelog status
2. **During Updates**: Maintain version consistency and proper formatting
3. **After Updates**: Verify links, dates, and cross-references are accurate
4. **Quality Check**: Ensure updates align with actual implementation progress

### Plans

### Plan Location
Save plans under the injected `Plan dir:` path from the `## Naming` context.
Do not assume the configured `Plans:` path; batch child-project installs may point plans back to the umbrella root.

**Format:** Use naming pattern from `## Naming` section injected by hooks.

**Example:** `Plan dir: /workspace/root/plans/251101-1505-authentication-and-profile-implementation/`

#### File Structure

##### Overview Plan (plan.md)
- Keep generic and under 80 lines
- List each phase with status/progress
- Link to detailed phase files
- Key dependencies

##### Phase Files (phase-XX-name.md)
Fully respect the workflow rules in `./.codex/rules/development-rules.md`.
Each phase file should contain:

**Context Links**
- Links to related reports, files, documentation

**Overview**
- Priority
- Current status
- Brief description

**Key Insights**
- Important findings from research
- Critical considerations

**Requirements**
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements

**Architecture**
- System design
- Component interactions
- Data flow

**Related Code Files**
- List of files to modify
- List of files to create
- List of files to delete

**Implementation Steps**
- Detailed, numbered steps
- Specific instructions

**Todo List**
- Checkbox list for tracking

**Success Criteria**
- Definition of done
- Validation methods

**Risk Assessment**
- Potential issues
- Mitigation strategies

**Security Considerations**
- Auth/authorization
- Data protection

**Next Steps**
- Dependencies
- Follow-up tasks
